## ⚠️ **PLATFORMS WITH SERIOUS CONCERNS**

### **Outlier AI & Remotasks (Scale AI Subsidiaries)**
While these are heavily advertised, there are **widespread reports of non-payment**:

- Accusations of mass non-payment growing against Scale AI's subsidiary, Outlier AI
- Remotasks excludes certain EU countries (e.g., Romania), contradicting claims of global availability
- Remotasks shut down entirely in Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan; stopped accepting new sign-ups in Thailand, Vietnam, and Poland
- Platform is not organized properly, work is not structured and no clear plan to handle user queries

**I recommend avoiding these platforms** based on the documented issues with payment and sudden account closures.

## **Important Warnings:**

1. **Inconsistent work:** There will be days when you won't earn anything because there aren't any tasks available

2. **Variable pay rates:** Earnings vary significantly by location, expertise, and task difficulty

3. **No guaranteed income:** This is gig work - not a stable job

4. **Qualification tests:** Most platforms require passing tests before you can work

5. **Payment delays:** Some workers report waiting weeks for payment

## **Realistic Expectations:**

This work typically provides **supplemental income** rather than a full-time salary. The most successful approach is to:
- Join multiple platforms simultaneously
- Be patient with task availability
- Read worker reviews on Reddit and Glassdoor before committing significant time
- Never rely on this as your sole income source
