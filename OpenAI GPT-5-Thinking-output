# EU‑friendly ways to earn by training AI (LLMs & more)

This is a living, **editable** briefing for platforms and programs where individuals in the EU can get paid to help train/evaluate AI systems. Curated for practical use: how they work, what they pay, payout rails, EU/KYC friction, and reputation notes.

> Scope includes LLM prompt/reasoning tasks, RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback), safety red‑teaming, model evaluation, data labeling/annotation, and research studies relevant to AI.

## Which should you try first (EU angle)?

* **You want steady & legit rails, EU‑friendly:** **Clickworker+UHRS**, **Prolific**.
* **You want higher pay for strong writing/reasoning:** **Outlier**, **DataAnnotation**, **Surge AI**.
* **You’re a verified expert (law/med/finance/engineering):** **Mercor** (+ Outlier expert tracks).
* **You want constant microtasks and don’t mind variance:** **Toloka**, **Remotasks**.

---

## Practical playbook (fast start)

1. **Open two tracks**: one “steady baseline” (Clickworker+UHRS or Prolific) + one “upside track” (Outlier/DataAnnotation/Surge).
2. **Pass quals early**: Spend an evening on UHRS exams + one Outlier/DataAnnotation assessment.
3. **Track your yield**: Log minutes per task and effective €/h; drop sub‑€8/h queues unless they unlock higher tiers.
4. **Protect your status**: Read each project’s quality rubric; don’t rush submissions—strike speed/quality balance.
5. **Handle taxes**: In Poland/EU, treat this as **self‑employment/contractor** income; keep invoices/payout reports and set aside income tax + ZUS where applicable.

---

## Risk & ethics notes

* **Contractor status**: You’re not an employee; you lack benefits and guaranteed minimum wage. Expect on/off work.
* **KYC/ID**: Use unique strong creds; expect identity checks with payroll providers (e.g., Deel/Hyperwallet/PayPal).
* **Data security**: Never paste confidential client/employer data into prompts/tasks.
* **Mental load**: Safety/red‑teaming can expose you to disturbing content; take breaks, use content‑filters if available.
* **EU compliance**: Keep an eye on the EU AI Act rollout and platform classification changes; rules may affect task scope and disclosures.
